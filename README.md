**This ruby application finds out scheduling order of jobs with respect to their dependencies**

We could also simply use tsort method on input string jobs as described here in Ruby doc  
http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.2/libdoc/tsort/rdoc/TSort.html


Implemented approach identifies jobs, job_pool, scheduling service and other entities to design a custom solution.

Run application as: **ruby application.rb**

And enter **input as**:  
a=>b  
b=>nil  
where each line indicates a job and its dependency

When done entering jobs as input, press ex or exit to get the output.
